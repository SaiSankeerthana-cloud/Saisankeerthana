## üìÇ Projects  

<details>
<summary><strong>Diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy Using Deep Learning</strong></summary>
<br>
Developed a CNN-based automated diagnostic system using Kaggle‚Äôs Diabetic Retinopathy Dataset to classify retinal fundus images by severity, enabling early detection and reducing clinician workload. Collected and preprocessed imaging data, trained and validated deep learning models, and benchmarked performance against existing literature to ensure clinical relevance.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>AI-Driven ECG Arrhythmia Diagnosis</strong></summary>
<br>
Developed an AI-based tool leveraging CNNs and LSTMs to detect ECG arrhythmias with 99.56% accuracy using the MIT-BIH dataset. Implemented preprocessing and feature extraction for real-time analysis, providing a user-friendly interface to support rapid and interpretable cardiovascular diagnosis.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Detection (PyRx & DOCKTHOR)</strong></summary>
<br>
Performed virtual screening of ~100 coumarin derivatives against BACE1 and AChE enzymes using PyRx and DOCKTHOR. Analyzed top compounds with BIOVIA Discovery Studio and SWISSADME to identify potential inhibitors, demonstrating therapeutic potential to prevent amyloid plaque formation in Alzheimer‚Äôs patients.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Analysis of Variance in Patient Recovery Times</strong></summary>
<br>
Conducted ANOVA and post-hoc Bonferroni tests to compare recovery times and patient satisfaction across three treatment methods. Findings highlighted Treatment C as the most effective, emphasizing the value of evidence-based treatment selection to optimize patient outcomes.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Classification of Epileptic Seizures</strong></summary>
<br>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Classifying Obesity Levels</strong></summary>
<br>
Developed predictive models with Random Forest and Logistic Regression using the UCI Obesity Dataset. Analyzed correlations between family history, physical activity, and diet, achieving 99.1% training accuracy and highlighting critical factors in obesity prevention and management.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Impact of Socio-Demographic Factors on ER Utilization</strong></summary>
<br>
Analyzed pediatric ER usage using 2021 NSCH data to explore effects of race, poverty, insurance status, and caregiver education. Identified disparities in ER dependency, informing targeted interventions and policies to improve access to preventive care.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Sleep Efficiency Analysis</strong></summary>
<br>
