Dedicated data analytics professional with a unique blend of healthcare and technology expertise, I am passionate about leveraging data-driven solutions to solve complex healthcare challenges. With a background in pharmacy and a Master‚Äôs degree in Health Informatics specializing in Health Data Analytics from George Mason University, I bring a strong foundation in machine learning, predictive analytics, and healthcare informatics.

A recent highlight of my work includes developing a deep learning model for ECG arrhythmia diagnosis, achieving over 98% accuracy, delivering real-time insights to assist medical professionals in early detection and intervention. I also conducted a data-driven study on the correlation between family history, physical activity, and obesity, uncovering actionable insights through advanced machine learning techniques.

With expertise in Python, SQL, Tableau, and Excel, I specialize in data visualization, statistical modeling, and AI-driven healthcare analytics. I am eager to contribute my skills to innovative projects that bridge the gap between healthcare and technology, driving impactful, evidence-based decision-making.

## Projects

<details>
<summary><strong>AI Driven ECG Arrhythmia Diagnosis</strong></summary>
<br>
Developed an AI-based diagnostic tool leveraging deep learning models like CNNs and LSTMs for accurate ECG arrhythmia detection. Utilized the MIT-BIH dataset, applying advanced preprocessing techniques such as denoising and feature extraction. Achieved high classification accuracy (up to 99.56%), providing real-time analysis with a user-friendly interface for medical professionals. This project offers a significant advancement in cardiovascular healthcare by enabling rapid, interpretable, and efficient arrhythmia diagnosis.

<details>
<summary><strong>Alzheimer Disease Detection using PyRx and DOCKTHOR Software</strong></summary>
<br>
Conducted virtual screening of approximately 100 coumarin derivatives for BACE1 (PDB ID-7D5A) and AChE (PDB ID-2CMF) using PYRX and DOCKTHOR software. Selected the top 10 coumarin derivatives based on virtual screening scores and performed detailed docking studies using DOCKTHOR online tool for both 7D5A and 2CMF. ‚Å†Analyzed the docking scores, interactions between protein and ligand, and properties of coumarin derivatives using BIOVIA DISCOVERY STUDIO, SWISSADME, and MOLINSPIRATION tools, respectively. Concluded that the selected coumarin derivatives effectively inhibit BACE1 enzyme and AChE, demonstrating potential for treating Alzheimer's disease by preventing the formation of amyloid plaques.

<details>
<summary><strong> Analysis of Variance in Patient Recovery Times Across Different Treatment</strong></summary>
<br>
Conducted statistical analysis to compare recovery times and patient satisfaction across three treatment methods using simulated data. Applied ANOVA and post-hoc Bonferroni tests to evaluate significant differences. 
Key findings revealed Treatment C had the shortest recovery time and highest satisfaction scores, while Treatment B performed least favorably. Results emphasize the importance of evidence-based treatment selection for improving patient outcomes and satisfaction.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong> Classification of Epileptic Seizures</strong></summary>
<br>
Classification of Epileptic Seizures using YOLOV3 algorithm to detect seizures in children integrated into a web-based application for easy accessibility and real-time monitoring. Improved 85% over the existing seizures interns of accuracy and speed leading to better clinical support for children with epilepsy.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong> Classifying Obesity Levels</strong></summary>
<br>
Developed predictive models to classify obesity levels using the UCI Obesity Dataset, exploring correlations between family history, physical activity, and dietary habits. Leveraged data preprocessing in SQL Server and implemented machine learning models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression) in Weka. Achieved 99.1% training accuracy and highlighted the critical role of genetic and lifestyle factors in obesity prevention and management.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong> Impact of Socio-Demographic Factors on Emergency Room Utilization</strong></summary>
<br>
Conducted an in-depth analysis of pediatric emergency room usage using data from the 2021 National Survey of Children‚Äôs Health. Explored the effects of race, poverty, gender, insurance consistency, and caregiver education. Key findings highlighted disparities, with Black children and uninsured populations showing higher ER dependency. Results informed targeted policy recommendations to reduce healthcare inequities and improve access to preventive care.
</details>
<details>
  
<summary><strong> Sleep Efficiency - Sleep Cycle</strong></summary>
<br>
Conducted an in-depth analysis of sleep efficiency using a Kaggle dataset, exploring correlations between lifestyle factors (age, gender, caffeine/alcohol consumption, smoking, exercise) and sleep quality. 
Utilized data visualization, statistical methods, and machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict sleep efficiency. Delivered insights to enhance sleep quality through targeted interventions.
